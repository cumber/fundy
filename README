Fundy requires the PyPy translation framework, and the Py library.

PyPy release 1.1.0 can be downloaded from http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/download.html. This package also includes the Py library.

To use Fundy, all that is needed is that the path to the extracted PyPy 1.1.0 sources appears in PYTHONPATH.
